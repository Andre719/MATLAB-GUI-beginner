# MATLAB-GUI-beginner
This is the first time I write codes with GUI in MATLAB.

The program is the school PRP project. It is a user interface system about collection of water pressure in the real-time water supply network and warning if there are any water pipes burst. This is a predict model and not such accurate.

Running environment is under MATLAB and need ojdbc.jar in order to connect to the water supply network database.
